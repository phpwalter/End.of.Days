### Roland Banks: The Fed

**Background:**
Roland Banks was a diligent and by-the-book agent working for the Bureau of Investigation, the precursor to the modern FBI. Growing up in a small town, Roland was always fascinated by law and order, influenced by his father, who was a respected sheriff. His ambition and dedication led him to rise quickly through the ranks of the Bureau.

As an agent, Roland excelled in solving high-profile cases and was known for his keen eye for detail and relentless pursuit of justice. However, his career took a dark turn when he was assigned to investigate a series of gruesome and bizarre murders in Arkham, Massachusetts. The case, which initially seemed like the work of a deranged serial killer, soon revealed a more sinister and otherworldly aspect.

**The Turning Point:**
During his investigation in Arkham, Roland encountered evidence of the supernatural, which contradicted his rational and methodical worldview. Strange symbols, eldritch creatures, and whispers of ancient, malevolent entities began to haunt him. Despite the danger and the mental toll it took, Roland felt compelled to uncover the truth and stop the horrors from spreading.

In the present, Roland operates on the fringes of both the law and the occult. He is determined to protect humanity from the eldritch threats lurking in the shadows, even if it means confronting the darkness within himself.

### Narrative Hook for Roland:

### Narrative Hook for Roland Banks

#### **Introduction Scene:**

Roland Banks arrives in Arkham just as twilight shrouds the town in an eerie mist. He checks into a small, dimly lit, dingy rooming house where privacy, as are the roaches, the only guarantee. As he enters his room, the worn floorboards creak beneath his weight, and the stale air carries a faint, musty odor of a room that hasn't been cleaned in living memory. The room is sparsely furnished, with a single bed, a rickety chair, and a desk that has seen better days.

Roland places his suitcase on the bed and methodically unpacks it, his movements deliberate and precise. He removes a large folder from the false boon of his suitcase and tosses it on the desk. Out sills newspaper clippings, photographs, and handwritten notes. Each piece of evidence tells a fragment of a chilling story about disappearances and strange occurrences linked to the Arkham Woods. He sits at the desk, pulling out a cigarette that casts a faint glow on the papers, slightly dimmer than the bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. As he studies the materials, a faint knock scratches at the door, barely audible above the whispering wind outside.

Without a thought, Roland is up, his hand on his sidearm. Seemingly on its own, the door noisily opens, revealing a hooded figure enveloped in darkness. The neon light from the hall casts a long, flickering shadow across the door. The hood obscures the Figure's face.

#### **Dialogue Example:**

Cloaked Figure: "Mr. Banks, I've been expecting you."

Roland narrows his eyes, his hand never straying from his gun.

Roland: "And who might you be?"

The cloaked figure steps into the room without a sound, not waiting for an invitation. The door closes as noiselessly as it opened. Closing with a soft, almost imperceptibleÂ click. The hooded Figure moves with an unnerving silence as if their very presence is an extension of the shadows that now envelop the room.

Cloaked Figure: "A friend... of sorts. We share a common enemy."

Roland's curiosity stirs, but he's not buying what they're selling.

Roland: "You're going to have to be more specific. Start talking, or start walking."

The Figure slowly lowers its hood, revealing a weathered face marked by years of hardship and fear. Long gray and white streaked hair. Her deep blue eyes have a glow all their own, a sadness that betrays years of pain, and a strength that would make weaker men cower. Roland stood his ground.

Cloaked Figure: "Arkham Woods. It whispers. A cult hides in that darkness. I've seen what they do to those who wander too close. I've lost... people. And now, they're coming for more."

Roland's expression hardens as he listens. Intrigued, but something just doesn't smell right.

Cloaked Figure: "You seek redemption, Mr. Banks."

That made him blink.

"This is your chance. But be warned, the forest holds secrets darker than you can imagine. If you go in, there may be no coming back."

Roland meets her gaze, a thousand questions running through his mind.

Roland: "I've faced darkness before. Whoever's out there, I'll put an end to it."

The Figure replied, "Oh no, Mr. Banks, it's no whomever, it's most assuredly a whatever."

As Roland moves back toward the desk, glass from the window explodes into the room, and the hooded Figure slams into the back wall as if hit by a truck.

Roland instantly drops to the ground, realizing the shot was meant for him. If he hadn't moved just then, his brain would be all over that wall.

He reached down, took off a shoe, and exploded the bare bulb; the room instantly went black. He crawled to the wall opposite the window and looked up to get a glimpse of his would-be assassin.

He saw another hood figure dart across the roof of the building across the street. He knew it was too far for his revolver to hit anything.

Looking at what remained of the deaf woman, he wondered if he really was the target or if it was meant to make sure she didn't talk.

Either way, he repacked, stuffed the files back in his case, and left through the back door, down the alley, and into the mists.

If Roland had looked back, he would have seen several hooded figures standing at the ally's end, their long shadows stretching out toward him. After a moment, they turned and vanished into the night.
