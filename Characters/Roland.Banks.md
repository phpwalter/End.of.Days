Roland Banks is a character from "Arkham Horror: The Card Game," a living card game set in the Lovecraftian horror universe. Here's a detailed backstory for Roland Banks:

### Roland Banks: The Fed

**Background:**
Roland Banks was a diligent and by-the-book agent working for the Bureau of Investigation, the precursor to the modern FBI. Growing up in a small town, Roland was always fascinated by law and order, influenced by his father, who was a respected sheriff. His ambition and dedication led him to rise quickly through the ranks of the Bureau.

**Professional Life:**
As an agent, Roland excelled in solving high-profile cases and was known for his keen eye for detail and relentless pursuit of justice. However, his career took a dark turn when he was assigned to investigate a series of gruesome and bizarre murders in Arkham, Massachusetts. The case, which initially seemed like the work of a deranged serial killer, soon revealed a more sinister and otherworldly aspect.

**The Turning Point:**
During his investigation in Arkham, Roland encountered evidence of the supernatural, which contradicted his rational and methodical worldview. Strange symbols, eldritch creatures, and whispers of ancient, malevolent entities began to haunt him. Despite the danger and the mental toll it took, Roland felt compelled to uncover the truth and stop the horrors from spreading.

**Personal Struggles:**
As he delved deeper into the mysteries of Arkham, Roland's once-clear sense of reality began to blur. The horrors he witnessed and the secrets he uncovered strained his sanity and eroded his trust in the institutions he once believed in. He became a man torn between his duty as an investigator and the overwhelming fear of the unknown.

**Current Status:**
In the present, Roland operates on the fringes of both the law and the occult. He is determined to protect humanity from the eldritch threats lurking in the shadows, even if it means confronting the darkness within himself. Armed with his service revolver and a growing knowledge of the arcane, Roland fights to keep the horrors of the mythos at bay, all while grappling with his deteriorating sanity and the constant threat of being consumed by the very evils he seeks to destroy.

### Key Traits:
- **Dedication:** Roland's sense of duty drives him to continue his fight against the mythos despite the personal cost.
- **Rationality vs. Madness:** His struggle to reconcile his logical mindset with the irrational horrors he faces is a central theme in his story.
- **Isolation:** Roland often works alone, as his experiences have alienated him from his peers and left him wary of trusting others.
