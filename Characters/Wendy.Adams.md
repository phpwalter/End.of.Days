### Full Name: Wendy Adams, Orphan

**Background:**
Wendy Adams was born into a world of whispers and shadows. Her parents, both mysterious figures involved in the occult, vanished under inexplicable circumstances when she was just a child. Left alone in the unforgiving streets of Arkham, she learned to fend for herself, relying on her wits and an almost preternatural sense of danger.

**Professional Life:**
While Wendy never held a conventional job, she became adept at surviving by any means necessary. Her time on the streets taught her skills in lock-picking, stealth, and minor thievery. Her talents drew the attention of local law enforcement and unsavory characters alike, making her both a wanted and invaluable figure in the underbelly of Arkham.

**The Turning Point:**
Wendy's life took a dramatic turn when she discovered a hidden cache of her parents' notes and artifacts. Hidden within a dilapidated old chest in the attic of her childhood home, the cache was filled with leather-bound journals, cryptic diagrams, and ancient relics. The notes detailed her parents' involvement in a secret society dedicated to combating eldritch horrors. Among the artifacts were protective talismans, forbidden tomes, and a peculiar amulet that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. This discovery not only unveiled the dangerous world her parents were entangled in but also hinted at a larger, more insidious plot threatening Arkham and possibly the world.

**Personal Struggles:**
Haunted by her parents' disappearance and the horrors she encounters, Wendy struggles with a constant fear of abandonment and a profound sense of loneliness. Her encounters with the supernatural often leave her teetering on the brink of madness, forcing her to constantly fight for her sanity.

**Current Status:**
Now a key figure in the fight against the eldritch horrors threatening Arkham, Wendy uses her skills and her parents' knowledge to uncover and thwart the sinister plots of otherworldly beings. Her journey is one of survival and discovery, as she navigates the perilous line between reality and the nightmare that seeks to consume her.

### Key Traits:
- **Resilience:** Wendy's experiences have forged her into a survivor, capable of withstanding both physical and psychological hardships.
- **Resourcefulness:** Her street smarts and adaptability make her a formidable opponent against the unpredictable forces of the occult.
- **Solitude:** Wendy's isolation fuels her determination, but also highlights her vulnerability to the very loneliness she fears.
