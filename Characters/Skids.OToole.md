**Background:**
Born into poverty, Michael "Skids" O'Toole grew up in the rough neighborhoods of Boston, Massachusetts. His early life was marked by hardship and a constant struggle for survival, which molded him into a resourceful and cunning individual. His father, an Irish immigrant, worked long hours in the shipyards, while his mother took in laundry to make ends meet. From a young age, Skids learned that life was a constant battle, and only the shrewd and the quick-witted thrived.

**Professional Life:**
Skids' natural talent for card games and his quick reflexes led him to a life of small-time gambling and con games. He frequented the seedy underbellies of Boston, earning a reputation as a skilled, albeit dishonest, gambler. His ability to read people and manipulate situations to his advantage made him a feared and respected figure among the local lowlifes. However, his illicit activities eventually caught the attention of the law, and Skids found himself in and out of jail throughout his twenties.

**The Turning Point:**
The turning point in Skids' life came when he was accused of a serious crime. Framed by a corrupt police officer who held a grudge against him, Skids faced a lengthy prison sentence. While incarcerated, he befriended Dr. Alistair Crowley, a former university professor who taught ancient history at Miskatonic University. Dr. Crowley, imprisoned for allegedly conducting illegal and dangerous occult experiments, introduced Skids to the world of occult studies. Intrigued by the mysteries of the unknown, Skids immersed himself in esoteric texts and arcane knowledge. His newfound interest gave him a sense of purpose and a burning desire to uncover the hidden truths of the universe.
