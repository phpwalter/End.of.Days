### Contextual Adjustments

   - Gradually increase DCs as players level up and gain more skills to maintain difficulty.

#### Examples in Context

   - **Base DC**: 15 (Medium) for a rough cliff.
   - **Modifiers**:
      - **Wet Conditions**: +5 (Total DC 20, Hard)

2. **Deciphering Ancient Text**

### Setting Appropriate DCs
To set a DC, consider the following factors:

1. **Task Difficulty**: Use the standard DCs as a baseline.
    - **Routine tasks** should be **Very Easy** or **Easy**.
    - **Common adventuring tasks** fall under **Medium**.
    - **Challenging tasks** are **Hard** or higher.

2. **Character Skill Levels**:
    - Consider the proficiency and abilities of the characters attempting the task.
    - Tasks should be challenging but achievable, promoting player engagement and satisfaction.

3. **Circumstantial Modifiers**:
    - Adjust DCs based on the environment or conditions.
    - **Examples**: A wet surface might make climbing harder (increase DC), while a well-crafted tool could make picking a lock easier (decrease DC).

### Additional Factors for Setting DCs

#### Task Familiarity and Skill Level
- **Proficiency**: Characters proficient in a skill should find typical tasks easier.
   - A proficient rogue might find a DC 15 lock-picking task routine.
- **Experience**: Characters with experience in a task type might receive bonuses or face lower DCs.

#### Circumstantial Modifiers
- **Environment**: Conditions can increase or decrease difficulty.
   - Darkness, distractions, or adverse weather might increase a DC.
   - Good lighting, assistance, or ideal conditions might decrease a DC.
- **Equipment**: Using specialized tools can impact DCs.
   - Thievesâ€™ tools might lower the DC for picking locks.
   - A well-researched map could reduce the DC for navigating an unknown area.

#### Example Adjustments
- **Environmental Impact**:
   - Performing a task in the rain might add +2 to the DC.
   - Completing the same task with help from an ally might reduce the DC by 2.
- **Tool Use**:
   - Using high-quality tools might decrease a DC by 1 or 2 points.
   - Using improvised tools might increase the DC by 2 or more points.

### Examples of Setting DCs

- **Finding a hidden door** in a well-lit room might be **DC 15** (Medium).
- **Persuading a guard** who is neutral towards the party might be **DC 10** (Easy).
- **Picking a complicated lock** without proper tools could be **DC 25** (Very Hard).

### Tips for DMs

- **Consistency**: Ensure DCs remain consistent across similar tasks to maintain fairness.
- **Contextual Adjustments**: Adapt DCs to reflect story elements and world-building, enhancing immersion.
- **Player Feedback**: Be receptive to player input, adjusting DCs if tasks seem too easy or hard over time.

### Example Scenario
If players need to **cross a narrow bridge** during a storm:
- Base DC for crossing a narrow bridge: **DC 10** (Easy)
- Modifier for the storm conditions: +5
- Final DC: **DC 15** (Medium)
