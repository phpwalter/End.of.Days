#### Monsters
Detail the stats and abilities of the various monsters in Mansions of Madness, First Edition.

The "Horror Rating" of a monster represents the psychological impact or fear that the monster induces in investigators when they encounter it. This rating affects how investigators must handle the presence of the monster and can influence the gameplay in the following ways:
1. **Horror Tests:** When an investigator enters a room with a monster (or a monster enters a room with an investigator), the investigator must make a Horror Test. The Horror Test is a Willpower check modified by the monster's Horror Rating.
- **High Damage Output:** Typically 4 or more damage per attack.
- **Medium Damage Output:** Typically 2-3 damage per attack.
- **Low Damage Output:** Typically 1 damage per attack.

2. **Sanity Loss:** Failing a Horror Test typically results in the investigator losing sanity points. The higher the Horror Rating, the more likely it is that the investigator will fail the test and suffer sanity loss.
