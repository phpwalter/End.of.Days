Detail the stats and abilities of the various monsters in Mansions of Madness, First Edition.

The "Horror Rating" of a monster represents the psychological impact or fear that the monster induces in investigators when they encounter it. This rating affects how investigators must handle the presence of the monster and can influence the gameplay in the following ways:
1. **Horror Tests:** When an investigator enters a room with a monster (or a monster enters a room with an investigator), the investigator must make a Horror Test. The Horror Test is a Willpower check modified by the monster's Horror Rating.
- **High Damage Output:** Typically 4 or more damage per attack.
- **Medium Damage Output:** Typically 2-3 damage per attack.
- **Low Damage Output:** Typically 1 damage per attack.

2. **Sanity Loss:** Failing a Horror Test typically results in the investigator losing sanity points. The higher the Horror Rating, the more likely it is that the investigator will fail the test and suffer sanity loss.

         - The Star-Spawn of Cthulhu, also known as Cthulhi, are ancient beings that first appeared in the story "At the Mountains of Madness" by H.P. Lovecraft in 1931. These creatures came to Earth alongside Cthulhu and currently reside in the sunken city of R'lyeh, where they remain in a deep slumber, dreaming with their master.
         - The Star-Spawn closely resemble their progenitor, Cthulhu, and may all be descended from him. They arrived on Earth many eons ago, constructing a great city on the newly-risen continent of R'lyeh. This incursion led to a conflict with the Elder Things of the Antarctic, who eventually were forced back into the ocean. After a peace agreement, both races settled into their respective cities. However, the city of R'lyeh ultimately sank beneath the waves, trapping Cthulhu and his spawn within its depths.
         - It is believed that the Star-Spawn will awaken with Cthulhu when R'lyeh rises again above the ocean. Some speculate that a few of these beings may still be free, awaiting the day when their master returns.

   - **Lore**:
      - The Hound of Tindalos is a creature that originates from the distant past or possibly another dimension. First appearing in the story "The Hounds of Tindalos" by Frank Belknap Long in 1929, these creatures appear much like green hairless dogs with blue tongues, or like black formless shadows. They dwell in Tindalos, a city of corkscrew towers, but are known to travel to other places and times to track their prey. Attempts to journey back in time via psychic means attract the Hounds' attention, allowing them to follow their prey through time and space until the person is caught and killed. According to Halpin Chalmers, the noted occultist, these creatures have descended through "angled" time, while normal life has developed through "curves." A hound must materialize itself through an angle; thus, a person kept in a perfectly round room would be safe from the beast's attack.

   - **Lore**:
       - Riots are a terrifying manifestation of collective human fear and anger. When panic spreads and law and order break down, even ordinary citizens can become dangerous, driven by mob mentality to commit acts of violence and destruction. In the world of Arkham, these events are often influenced by darker, supernatural forces, pushing people to act against their better nature.
       - The appearance of a Riot is a sign that the social fabric is tearing apart, usually triggered by the influence of malevolent entities or cursed artifacts. These events can quickly escalate, leading to widespread chaos and destruction, with the terror level in Arkham rising as a result.
       - Dispersing a Riot is not just a physical challenge but also a mental one, requiring those who confront it to stay calm and resist the overwhelming fear that grips the crowd. Failing to do so can result in significant harm to both body and mind, making these encounters particularly dangerous.

- **Lore**:
    - Hunting Horrors are monstrous creatures resembling black-winged serpents of immense size, first introduced in H.P. Lovecraft's "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath" (1927). Originally, these creatures inhabited only a few worlds, but they have since been sighted across various galaxies, often seen flying through the vastness of space. They are known to be extremely dangerous, with a unique vulnerability to extremely bright light, though such a powerful light-source is rarely available to those unfortunate enough to encounter them.
    - These horrors serve Nyarlathotep, who often dispatches them to deal with those who have angered him.

      - The Mi-go, also known as Fungi from Yuggoth, are extraterrestrial beings with a vast empire reaching beyond the stars, with its closest outpost on Pluto, known as Yuggoth. They first appeared in the story "The Whisperer in Darkness" by H.P. Lovecraft in 1930. These beings resemble winged crustaceans with egg-shaped heads that constantly change color, a key aspect of their communication.
      - The Mi-go arrived on Earth during the Jurassic period, settling in the Northern Hemisphere after fending off attacks from the Elder Things. They show great interest in Earth's mineral deposits, which are scarce in other parts of the universe. These minerals are crucial for growing the fungi they use as food. To obtain these resources, the Mi-go have established mining bases in regions like the Andes, the Appalachians, and the Himalayas. These bases are often hidden, with local populations recruited to maintain secrecy. However, their presence is often revealed through folklore, especially when Mi-go bodies are discovered after floods, as they cannot survive submersion in water.

      - Zombies are dangerous not only due to their physical strength but also because they are often encountered in groups, making them a persistent threat in any encounter. Their origins are tied to necromantic practices, and they often serve as minions to more powerful undead entities or dark sorcerers. Despite their slow movements, zombies' sheer numbers and tenacity make them formidable opponents in combat.

           - Mansions of Madness 2E: "It is some terrible and powerful fusion of fish and human being. Croaking, hopping, with deadly teeth and claws."
   - **Lore**:
       - Deep Ones are ancient, fish-like humanoid beings that first appeared in H.P. Lovecraft's "The Shadow Over Innsmouth" (1931). These creatures are known for their worship of Dagon, Hydra, and Cthulhu, and they inhabit cities built deep beneath the world's oceans, such as Y'ha-nthlei off the coast of Innsmouth, Ahu-Y'hloa near Cornwall, and other metropolises in the North Sea.

       - Physically, Deep Ones resemble bipedal frogs with scales, bulging eyes, gills, and webbed hands and feet. Their communication appears to be primarily telepathic, although they can produce croaking noises to communicate with their human agents.
       - A significant aspect of Deep One culture involves mating with humans, producing offspring who initially appear human but eventually undergo a metamorphosis into Deep Ones as they age. This transformation, known as the "Innsmouth Look," varies widely among individuals. Some never fully transition, remaining as Deep One Hybrids, while others transform into monstrous beings, often influenced by the dreams of Cthulhu.
       - The presence of Deep Ones is a sign of deep-seated corruption and ancient power, as they work tirelessly to further the aims of their dark gods, often leading to the rise of malevolent cults and the spread of their influence across coastal regions.

           - Arkham Horror 2E: "One man moved in a positively simian way, with long arms frequently touching the ground; while another figure — robed and tiaraed — seemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion."
           - Mansions of Madness 2E: "At first glance, he seems to be a human being, but the creature conceals a corrupt secret within its blood."
   - **Lore**:
       - The Deep One Hybrid is the result of a union between a human and a Deep One, a fish-like humanoid being that worships ancient deities like Dagon, Hydra, and Cthulhu. These hybrids initially appear to be normal humans but carry within them the genetic markers of their Deep One heritage. Over time, many Deep One Hybrids begin to show signs of transformation, developing features such as scales, webbed hands, and bulging eyes.
       - This transformation, often referred to as the "Innsmouth Look," is an indication that the hybrid is gradually becoming more like its Deep One ancestors. The length and severity of the transformation can vary, with some individuals fully transitioning into Deep Ones, while others remain in a hybrid state.
       - Deep One Hybrids are dangerous because they can blend into human society, concealing their true nature until it is too late. Their allegiance lies with the Deep Ones, and they often work to further the goals of these ancient beings, whether by subverting human institutions or by directly participating in dark rituals.
       - When encountered, Deep One Hybrids may seem deceptively weak, but their connection to the Deep Ones grants them abilities that can catch opponents off guard. Defeating a Deep One Hybrid in combat often comes at a cost, as their demise can trigger psychological trauma in those who confront them.
   - **Final Action**: Discard this card and gain another Deep One Hybrid card.

Their presence is often accompanied by a sudden chill, a sense of dread, or the flickering of lights as they interact with the physical world.

   - **Lore**:
       - The Priest of Dagon is a fanatical follower of the ancient sea god Dagon, a monstrous deity worshipped by the Deep Ones and their human acolytes. These priests are often found leading ceremonies in hidden coastal temples or conducting dark rituals in the name of their god. Their devotion to Dagon and their deep connection to the ocean give them unique abilities, making them formidable opponents.
       - Physically, the Priest of Dagon is often marked by aquatic features, hinting at their close ties to the Deep Ones. These features may include gills, webbed fingers, or an otherworldly appearance that betrays their human origins. They are particularly dangerous because of their mastery of dark magic, which they use to summon creatures from the depths or to curse those who oppose them.
       - In combat, the Priest of Dagon is protected by a resistance to magical attacks, making them difficult to defeat with conventional means. Their presence often heralds the coming of greater evils, as they work tirelessly to bring about the return of Dagon and other ancient beings from the ocean's depths.
       - These priests are not only religious leaders but also act as intermediaries between the human world and the realm of the Deep Ones.

- **Lore**:
    - The **Child of Dagon** is a terrifying result of the union between humans and the monstrous Deep Ones. These creatures are even less human than their Deep One Hybrid kin, with pronounced fish-like features, including bulging eyes, clammy skin, and an unsettling, amphibious demeanor. Their very presence is a reminder of the ancient and malevolent forces that lurk beneath the sea, serving as harbingers of Dagon's influence on the surface world.
    - Children of Dagon are often encountered in coastal regions, where their eerie appearance and behavior instill fear in those who encounter them. They serve as the foot soldiers of the Deep Ones, carrying out the will of their aquatic masters with a cold and unfeeling efficiency. Despite their humanoid form, there is little that remains of the human in them, as they have fully embraced their monstrous heritage.
    - These beings are highly dangerous, not just because of their physical abilities but also due to their unnerving presence, which can cause significant psychological trauma to those who face them. Their connection to Dagon grants them a measure of supernatural power, making them more formidable than they might initially appear.
    - The Child of Dagon is a living testament to the horrors that result from the mingling of human and Deep One bloodlines, serving as both a warning and a threat to those who would oppose the will of the ancient sea gods.
- **Final Action**: Discard this card and gain another Child of Dagon card.

- **Format**: Each attribute section has a clear sub-heading, which is appropriate. The values are well organized under these headings, though ensuring consistency in units and formats across different entities would enhance readability.

### 5. **Attacks**
- **Format**: The attacks are well-defined with clear descriptions and associated tests. Sub-sections for "Test Willpower" and "Test Dexterity" are appropriately formatted with "Pass" and "Fail" outcomes.

### 6. **Task**
- **Format**: The task format is clear but could use a brief description or clarification on what the symbols [l|t|san1] represent for consistency.

### 7. **Quote**
- **Format**: The quote is well-placed and adds thematic flavor, consistent with other game elements.
