Why, then, she dedicates so much of her research to so-called &quot;extra-sensory perception&quot; and the evidence of ghosts is baffling mystery to almost everyone who knows her.\n\nAgatha calls her field of study &quot;parasypcholoy&quot; in an attempt to remove the stigma associated with the occult in respectable academic circles. Her search for test subjects and data continually leads her to dangerous places and disreputable people, much to the despair of her long-suffering husband, Wilbur. But she is committed to her task, for reasons that only she seems to know.",
