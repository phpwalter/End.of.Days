Here is the list of elements for `"type_code": "investigator"` only, following the given comprehensive map:

### Roland Banks: The Fed
- **Name**: Roland Banks
    - **Subname**: The Fed
    - **Traits**: Agency. Detective.
    - **Type Code**: investigator
    - **Faction Code**: guardian

- **Skills**:
    - **Agility**: 2
    - **Combat**: 4
    - **Intellect**: 3
    - **Willpower**: 3

- **Stats**:
    - **Health**: 9
    - **Sanity**: 5

- **Flavor**:
    - **Front Text**: Everything by the book: every "i" dotted, every "t" crossed. It has worked, until now.
    - **Back Flavor**: Roland had always taken comfort in procedure and rules. As an agent in the Bureau, he was relieved to have guidelines to follow in any given situation. But lately, his Federal Agent's Handbook had been entirely unhelpful given the cases he'd been assigned. Try as he might, Roland could find no mention of what to do when confronted with strange creatures, gates through time and space, or magic spells. If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed it... and there's no way his superiors would understand. Roland knew he would have to handle this one himself.

- **Flavor**:
    - **Front Text**: "I know of books so powerful, they can rewrite reality."
    - **Back Flavor**: As a respected librarian at Miskatonic University, Daisy had always felt that books were the most important thing in her life. She explored in fiction what she abhorred in life: horror, violence, fear. Then, she stumbled across the John Dee translation of the Necronomicon. It was blasphemous, unholy, and too awful to be read. But given her studies in obscure and occult subjects, Daisy knew there was more truth than fiction within the book's pages. She began to wonder what other secrets the restricted collection of the Orne Library held...

    - **Back Flavor**: Skids hadn't planned on a life of crime. But sometimes doing the right thing means getting your hands dirty. The cops didn't care that Skids needed the money for his mother's operation. His mother died of her illness during the second year of his sentence. His cellmate, Brad Hollins, told him there were worse fates than death. He ranted and raved in a quiet voice every evening about the "Old Ones" and told Skids about bizarre adventures he'd had while dreaming. Skids didn't give it much thought until the night he woke to the sight of his cellmate bursting into flames. When Skids was finally released, he returned to Arkham, looking for answers.

They took Mama to the asylum, and Wendy went to the orphanage. Before they took her away, Mama gave her the necklace, to "protect her." Wendy stayed in the orphanage for several years before running away, deciding that she could take better care of herself on her own.
