## Spell Cards

### Rules
 - Spells represent the tomes or scrolls containing the knowledge
required to harness eldritch powers.
 - When an investigator gains a Spell, they claim a random copy of
that card faceup (art side up).
 - Spells are possessions. As such, they can be dropped, picked up, or
traded using the trade action.
 - Spells are double-sided. Such cards have information on both the
front and back of the card.
   - An investigator cannot look at the back of a Spell unless an
effect causes him to flip that card.
   - When an investigator flips a Spell, they immediately resolve the
effects on the back of that card. This usually includes discarding
the card and gaining another copy of that Spell.
 - Some Spells, called attack spells, have an attack icon and a damage
value. Such Spells can be used to attack monsters.
 - When an investigator discards a Spell, he returns it to the
Spell deck.
 - Investigators cannot look at the back of any card in the Spell deck.
