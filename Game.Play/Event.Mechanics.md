Got it! We'll focus on utilizing and incorporating the Event Cards from Mansions of Madness (MoM) into our campaign, keeping the mechanics as they are. Here's how you can effectively integrate these event cards into your game:

### 1. **Incorporating Event Cards**

Event Cards in MoM often introduce sudden changes, challenges, or story developments. We'll use these cards to keep the players on their toes and maintain the atmosphere of suspense and horror.

#### **Setting Up Event Cards**

- **Preparation**: Before the session, sort the Event Cards by type (e.g., Encounter, Mythos, Exploration) and shuffle them.
- **Distribution**: Decide how often to draw an Event Card (e.g., at the start of each in-game hour, after certain triggers, or at key narrative points).

### 2. **Triggering Event Cards**

Determine when Event Cards should be triggered. Here are some suggested triggers:

- **Time-Based Triggers**: Draw an Event Card every in-game hour or after a set number of rounds.
- **Exploration Triggers**: Draw an Event Card when the players enter a new room or discover a significant location.
- **Action-Based Triggers**: Draw an Event Card after players perform specific actions, such as solving a puzzle, defeating a monster, or interacting with an NPC.

### 3. **Types of Event Cards and Their Uses**

#### **Encounter Cards**

**Purpose**: Introduce unexpected encounters, including monsters, NPCs, and environmental hazards.

**Examples**:
- **Monsters**: The card reveals a sudden monster attack. Use the monster stats from MoM directly.
- **NPCs**: The card introduces an NPC with specific instructions on their role or behavior.
- **Environmental Hazards**: The card triggers a hazard, like a collapsing ceiling or sudden darkness.

**Incorporation**:
- Read the card aloud to the players, describing the encounter vividly.
- Resolve the encounter using the instructions on the card, maintaining the mechanics of MoM.

#### **Mythos Cards**

**Purpose**: Add supernatural or psychological elements to the game, impacting the characters’ sanity or introducing magical effects.

**Examples**:
- **Sanity Effects**: The card causes a sanity check or a temporary insanity effect.
- **Supernatural Occurrences**: The card describes a ghostly apparition, sudden temperature drop, or other eerie phenomena.

**Incorporation**:
- Describe the event in detail to create a suspenseful atmosphere.
- Apply the effects as stated on the card, ensuring the players react accordingly.

#### **Exploration Cards**

**Purpose**: Enhance exploration by revealing new information, items, or obstacles.

**Examples**:
- **Clues and Lore**: The card provides a clue or piece of the story, leading to further investigation.
- **Items and Artifacts**: The card reveals a useful item or artifact with specific mechanics.
- **Traps and Obstacles**: The card introduces a trap or obstacle that the players must overcome.

**Incorporation**:
- Use the card to guide the narrative, providing the players with new directions or challenges.
- Allow players to interact with the revealed elements, following the card’s instructions.

### 4. **Managing Event Card Frequency and Impact**

To maintain balance and pacing, control the frequency and impact of Event Cards.

#### **Frequency Control**

- **Adjust Drawing Rates**: Depending on the desired tension, draw Event Cards more or less frequently.
- **Randomization**: Use a random table to decide when to draw a card, adding unpredictability.

#### **Impact Management**

- **Scaling Challenges**: Adjust the difficulty of encounters and challenges based on the party’s level and capabilities.
- **Reward Balancing**: Ensure rewards from Event Cards (e.g., items, clues) are balanced with the difficulty of the challenges.

### 5. **Example of Event Card Integration in Gameplay**

**Scenario**: The players are exploring a haunted mansion.

**Trigger**: Upon entering a new room, an Event Card is drawn.

**Event Card Drawn**: "Sudden Darkness" (Mythos Card)

**Description**: The room is plunged into complete darkness. Players must navigate without sight, and any combat encounters have a penalty to attack rolls.

**Implementation**:
1. Describe the sudden darkness enveloping the room.
2. Apply the effects as per the card: players must make checks to navigate, and combat is more challenging due to the darkness.
3. Allow players to find a way to restore light or adapt to the situation, creating a dynamic and immersive experience.

By integrating these Event Cards, you can enrich your campaign with the unpredictable and thrilling elements of Mansions of Madness, creating a seamless blend of horror and adventure. If you have specific Event Cards you'd like to explore further or additional mechanics to integrate, let me know!
