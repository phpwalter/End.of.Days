Sure, here's the updated Sanity Mechanics for future reference:

### Sanity Mechanics

### 1. **Determining Starting Sanity Points (SP)**
**Formula for Starting SP**:
- **SP Calculation**: 1d10 + 10 + Wisdom modifier + character level

**Tracking SP**:
- Use a separate tracker for Sanity Points, distinct from Health Points.

### 2. **Sanity Loss**

**Trigger Events**:
- **Minor Horrors**: 1d4 SP loss (e.g., finding a blood-stained room)
- **Moderate Horrors**: 2d6 SP loss (e.g., encountering a ghost or minor monsters)
- **Major Horrors**: 2d10 SP loss (e.g., fighting a Deep One)
- **Eldritch Terrors**: 2d20 SP loss (e.g., witnessing a summoning ritual of a Great Old One)

### 3. **Trauma**

Introduce Trauma Cards to represent the mental impact of Sanity loss. These cards provide immediate and ongoing effects based on the severity of the Sanity loss.

#### Temporary Insanity
**Trigger**: Loss of 5 or more SP in a single instance.
- **Wisdom Saving Throw**: DC 15
- **Failure**: Temporary insanity effect lasting 1d10 minutes

**Temporary Insanity Effects**:
1. **Paranoia**: The character believes allies are plotting against them.
2. **Hallucinations**: The character perceives nonexistent entities or threats.
3. **Panic**: The character flees the source of fear.
4. **Catatonia**: The character is unresponsive and cannot act.

#### Long-Term Insanity
**Trigger**: SP drops below half of the maximum.
- **Effect Duration**: Lasts until SP is restored above half.

**Long-Term Insanity Effects**:
1. **Phobia**: Irrational fear of an object/situation.
2. **Mania**: Obsession with an idea/object.
3. **Depression**: Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws.
4. **Delusions**: Firm belief in something false.

#### Permanent Insanity
**Trigger**: SP reaches zero.
- **Effect**: Severe, possibly unplayable conditions.

**Permanent Insanity Effects**:
1. **Complete Madness**: Dangerous and uncontrollable behavior.
2. **Split Personality**: Alternate persona with different goals.
3. **Severe Delusions**: Complete detachment from reality.

#### Sanity Recovery
**Methods of Recovery**:
- **Rest**: Regain 1 SP per long rest.
- **Therapy**: Spend a week with a healer to restore 1d4 SP.
- **Magic**: Use spells like *Greater Restoration* to restore 1d10 SP.

#### Example Trauma Cards:

- **Temporary Trauma**:
    - **Paranoia**: Disadvantage on Perception checks for 1d10 minutes.
    - **Hallucinations**: See and hear things that aren't there for 1d6 minutes.

- **Long-Term Trauma**:
    - **Phobia**: Disadvantage on all checks when near the source of the fear (e.g., spiders) for 1d6 days.
    - **Insomnia**: Unable to take long rests effectively, gaining only half the benefits.

- **Permanent Trauma**:
    - **Madness**: Permanent disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until cured through significant means (e.g., Greater Restoration spell).
    - **Schizophrenia**: Periodic loss of control over the character, with the DM taking control for 1d6 rounds when triggered.


#### Acquiring Trauma Cards
When a character loses a significant amount of Sanity Points at once or drops below certain thresholds, they draw a Trauma Card.

- **Significant Loss**: Losing 5 or more SP in one encounter requires a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, draw a Temporary Trauma card.
- **Thresholds**:
    - **Below 50% SP**: Draw a Long-Term Trauma card.
    - **At 0 SP**: Draw a Permanent Trauma card.

#### **Healing Sanity**

Characters can recover Sanity Points through rest, spells, and roleplaying.

- **Short Rest**: Recover 1d4 SP with successful Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC 15).
- **Long Rest**: Recover 1d6 + Wisdom modifier SP.
- **Spells**: Specific spells like *Lesser Restoration* can restore a fixed amount of SP (e.g., 1d8 SP).
- **Roleplaying**: Completing certain objectives, resolving traumatic events, or receiving counseling from an NPC can restore SP or remove Trauma Cards.

### 4. **In-Game Implementation**

#### Scenario Example:

**Encounter with an Eldritch Horror**:
- **Sanity Loss**: The party encounters a nightmarish creature. Each character makes a Sanity Check (Wisdom saving throw, DC 15).
    - On a failure, they lose 1d10 SP.
    - If they lose 5 or more SP, they draw a Temporary Trauma card.
    - If their SP drops below 50%, they draw a Long-Term Trauma card.

**Temporary Trauma Card - Paranoia**:
- **Effect**: The character has disadvantage on Perception checks for the next 1d10 minutes.

**Long-Term Trauma Card - Insomnia**:
- **Effect**: The character has trouble sleeping, gaining only half the benefits of long rests for 1d6 days.

#### Example Scenarios with Updated SP Loss

**Encounter with a Deep One**:
- **Scenario**: The party encounters a Deep One in the mansion’s basement.
- **Mechanic**: Each character must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, they lose 2d10 SP. Characters who lose 5 or more SP must make an additional Wisdom saving throw to avoid temporary insanity.

**Exploring a Haunted Room**:
- **Scenario**: The party enters a room filled with ghostly apparitions and the remnants of a dark ritual.
- **Mechanic**: Each character must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). On a failure, they lose 2d6 SP. Characters who fail the check experience hallucinations for 1d10 minutes.

**Reading an Eldritch Tome**:
- **Scenario**: A character reads an ancient tome filled with forbidden knowledge.
- **Mechanic**: The character must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18). On a failure, they lose 2d20 SP. If their SP drops below half, they develop a long-term insanity effect, such as delusions about the tome’s content.
