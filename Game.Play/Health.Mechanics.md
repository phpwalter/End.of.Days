### Health Mechanics and Incorporating Condition Cards

To effectively merge the health mechanics of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) with the Condition Cards from Mansions of Madness (MoM), we need to focus on how injuries and Conditions affect characters. Here's a detailed guide to help you implement this integration:

### 1. **Health Points (HP)**

- **Standard HP System**: Use the standard HP system from D&D. Each character has a maximum HP determined by their class, level, and Constitution modifier.
- **Damage and Healing**: Damage is subtracted from a character's HP, and they can heal through rest, spells, and potions as per D&D rules.

### 2. **Condition Cards Integration**

**Condition Cards** from MoM add a layer of complexity by introducing physical and mental Conditions that affect characters when they suffer damage. Hereâ€™s how to integrate them:

#### Types of Condition Cards

- **Minor Condition**: Represents less severe injuries or conditions. These can occur when a character takes a moderate amount of damage (e.g., 10-25% of their max HP).
- **Major Condition**: Represents severe injuries or conditions. These can occur when a character takes a significant amount of damage (e.g., 50% or more of their max HP in one hit).

#### Implementing Condition Cards

- **Triggering Condition**:
    - **Minor Condition**: When a character's HP drops below 75% of their maximum, they must draw a Minor Condition card.
    - **Major Condition**: When a character's HP drops below 50% of their maximum, they must draw a Major Condition card.
- **Effects of Condition**:
    - Each Condition card details a specific condition or effect that impacts the character.
    - Minor Condition might include conditions like sprains, minor cuts, or fatigue.
    - Major Condition might include broken bones, severe bleeding, or organ damage.
- **Healing Condition**:
    - Condition effects can last until the character receives appropriate medical attention or magical healing.
    - Some Conditions may require specific spells (e.g., *Lesser Restoration* for Minor Condition, *Greater Restoration* for Major Condition).

### 3. **Condition Card Examples**

**Minor Condition Cards**:
1. **Sprained Ankle**: Disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws until healed.
2. **Minor Cut**: Lose 1 HP at the start of each turn until bandaged (DC 10 Medicine check).
3. **Fatigue**: Disadvantage on all skill checks until a short rest is taken.

**Major Condition Cards**:
1. **Broken Arm**: Cannot use two-handed weapons or cast spells with somatic components until healed.
2. **Severe Bleeding**: Lose 1d4 HP at the start of each turn until healed by a magical spell or a DC 15 Medicine check.
3. **Concussion**: Disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks and saving throws until healed.

### 4. **Additional Mechanics**

#### Critical Hits and Condition

- **Critical Hits**: When a character suffers a critical hit, they automatically draw a Major Condition card regardless of the amount of damage taken.
- **Death Saving Throws**: If a character fails a death saving throw, they draw a Major Condition card when they stabilize.

#### Rest and Healing

- **Short Rest**: Characters can attempt to heal Minor Condition with a successful Medicine check (DC 15) during a short rest.
- **Long Rest**: Minor Conditions are automatically healed after a long rest. Major Conditions require magical healing or extended medical care.
- **Magical Healing**: Certain spells can heal Conditions. For instance:
    - *Cure Wounds* can stabilize bleeding and heal minor cuts.
    - *Lesser Restoration* can heal Minor Conditions.
    - *Greater Restoration* can heal Major Conditions.

### 5. **Gameplay Examples**

#### Example 1: Minor Condition

- **Scenario**: A character takes 15 points of damage in a single hit, reducing their HP to 70% of their max.
- **Mechanic**: They draw a Minor Condition card and get "Sprained Ankle". They now have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws until healed.

#### Example 2: Major Condition

- **Scenario**: Another character takes a critical hit, suffering 25 points of damage, reducing their HP to 40% of their max.
- **Mechanic**: They draw a Major Condition card and get "Broken Arm". They can no longer use two-handed weapons or cast spells with somatic components until healed.

#### Example 3: Healing Condition

- **Scenario**: After a battle, the party takes a short rest. The character with a sprained ankle attempts a Medicine check (DC 15) to heal it.
- **Mechanic**: They succeed on the check, healing the Minor Condition. The character with the broken arm needs to find a healer or use a *Greater Restoration* spell to heal.

By incorporating these health mechanics and Condition Cards, you can add a deeper layer of realism and challenge to your D&D campaign, enhancing the horror and tension inspired by Mansions of Madness. Do you need further details on any specific aspect or additional mechanics?
